# numpy-random-package
An investigation into numpy random package

The main file to be graded for this assignment is
NumPy_Assignment_Christopher_Collins_G00387822.ipynb

In this file I cover the tasks

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.


### 1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

I give a brief background introduction to the overall purpose of the package

### 2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

For simple random data I've taken examples from W3 schools for, showing how NumPy can ranomise data for Floats and Integers

randint()
rand()

Then I cover the permutation functions which include
shuffle()
permutation()
 

### 3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
The five functions which I will cover will include

random.binom
numpy.random.geometric (recently changed to np.random.default_rng().geometric)
random.poisson
random.multinomial
random.normal

### 4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

I briefly cover the concepts of seeds and generating pseudorandom numbers using ideas from the online gambling industry and demonstrations of NumPy.
